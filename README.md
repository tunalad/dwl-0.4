## Missing Patches

-   [actualfullscreen](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/actualfullscreen/)
-   [alwaysontop](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/alwaysontop/)
-   [autostart](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/autostart/)
    - there is an autostart patch for dwl ([here](https://github.com/djpohly/dwl/wiki/autostart)), but it's like the [cool_autostart](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/cool_autostart/)
    - update 2: there's no need for this either, you can just -s option `dwl -s $XDG_DATA_HOME/dwm/autostart.sh`
-   [fixborders](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/alpha/)
    -   not required, dwl by itself does the transparency
-   [focusonnetactive](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/focusonnetactive/)
-   [systray](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/systray/)
    -   dwl doesn't come with a bar
-   [stackmfact](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/stackmfact/)
    - I don't really use this option so it's not really even necessary?
